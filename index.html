                The two main tasks involved were revamping and refactoring the entire renter experience software
                repository and building out features of a Leads Management System for real estate agents.
                I was in charge of the entire refactoring unit, from creating tickets in JIRA to
                tracking progress on my team in an AGILE fashion to writing and reviewing the React code.
                I was also given a recommendation by my Manager: <br> <br>
            <p class="modalText recommendation">"Kaiz and I worked very closely together on an essential project for the company. I
                appreciated Kaiz's persistence for excellence. Although new, he inspired the team to think through the
                code structure and to refactor the code so we can move forward with an improved velocity. He is a
                natural leader who saw a problem and inspired the team to solve it.
                Working with him was a breath of fresh air and hope to work with him again in the future.
                Best of luck to your future endeavors Kaiz!"<br><br>
