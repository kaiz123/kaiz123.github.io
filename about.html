        <p class="heading title">My Background</p>
        <p class="summary work">A graduate student in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering and a focus towards Web
        Architecture and Data Engineering. I am passionate about full stack development, building end to end products, right
        from dealing with large data in the cloud to coding the backend and frontend.
        
        I am skilled in a variety of programming languages, especially Java , Javascript and Python. I have detailed experience
        with frameworks and libraries like React , Node/ Express , Django and Spring and both SQL and NoSQL databases. I am also
        AWS certified and have worked with other cloud technologies like Google Cloud Platform.
        
        I have been the Co-technical head of the Association for Computing machinery when we were shown on various news channels
        for building an application for the government.
        
        I have also been the leader, writer and performer of the dramatics team Aura that won national level awards and were
        published in the newspapers for their streetplay on women empowerment.
        
        I love to apply new techniques to problem solving and am on a journey to help build better tools related to Computer
        Science.
